# The 'trait-gen' Crate

This library provides an attribute macro to generate the trait implementations for several types without needing custom declarative macros, code repetition, or blanket implementations. It makes the code easier to read and to maintain.

Here is a short example:

```rust
use trait_gen::trait_gen;

#[trait_gen(T -> u8, u16, u32, u64, u128)]
impl MyLog for T {
    fn my_log2(self) -> u32 {
        T::BITS - 1 - self.leading_zeros()
    }
}
```

The `trait_gen` attribute generates the following code by replacing `T` with the types given as arguments:

```rust
impl MyLog for u8 {
    fn my_log2(self) -> u32 {
        u8::BITS - 1 - self.leading_zeros()
    }
}
impl MyLog for u16 {
    fn my_log2(self) -> u32 {
        u16::BITS - 1 - self.leading_zeros()
    }
}
// and so on for the remaining types
```

## Usage

The attribute is placed before the pseudo-generic implementation code. The _generic argument_ is given first, followed by a right arrow (`->`) and a list of type arguments.

```rust
#[trait_gen(T -> Type1, Type2, Type3)]
impl Trait for T {
    // ...
}
```

The attribute macro successively substitutes the generic argument `T` in the code with the following types (`Type1`, `Type2`, `Type3`) to generate all the implementations.

All the [type paths](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/paths.html#paths-in-types) beginning with `T` in the code have this part replaced. For example, `T::default()` generates `Type1::default()`, `Type2::default()` and so on, but `super::T` is unchanged because it belongs to another scope.

The code must be compatible with all the types, or the compiler will trigger the relevant errors. For example, `#[trait_gen(T -> u64, f64)]` cannot be applied to `let x: T = 0;` because `0` is not a valid floating-point literal.

Finally, the actual type replaces any `${T}` occurrence in doc comments, macros, and string literals.

_Notes:_
- _Using the letter "T" is not mandatory; any type path will do. For example, `gen::Type` is fine too. But to make it easy to read and similar to a generic implementation, short upper-case identifiers are preferred._
- _Two or more attributes can be chained to generate all the combinations._
- _`trait_gen` isn't restricted to trait implementations: it can be used on type implementations too._
- _`type_gen` is a synonym attribute that can be used instead of `trait_gen` when the `type_gen` feature is enabled (it requires `use trait_gen::type_gen`)_.


## Motivation

There are several ways to generate multiple implementations:
- copy them manually
- use a declarative macro
- use a blanket implementation

The example of implementation above could be achieved with this **declarative macro**:

```rust
macro_rules! impl_my_log {
    ($($t:ty)*) => (
        $(impl MyLog for $t {
            fn my_log2(self) -> u32 {
                $t::BITS - 1 - self.leading_zeros()
            }
        })*
    )
}

impl_my_log! { u8 u16 u32 u64 u128 }
```

But it's noisy and harder to read than native code. We must write a custom macro each time, with its declaration, pattern, and translation of a few elements like the parameters (here, `$t`). Moreover, IDEs can't often provide contextual help or apply refactoring in the macro code.

It's also quite annoying and unhelpful to get this result when we're looking for the definition of a method when it has been generated by a declarative macro:

```rust
impl_my_log! { u8 u16 u32 u64 u128 }
```

Using a **blanket implementation** has other drawbacks:
- It forbids any other implementation except for types of the same crate that are not already under the blanket implementation, so it only works when the implementation can be written for all bound types, current and future.
- Finding a trait that corresponds to what we need to write is not always possible. The `num` crate provides a lot of help for primitives, for instance, but not everything is covered.
- Even when the operations and constants are covered by traits, it quickly requires a long list of trait bounds.

Writing the first example as a blanket implementation looks like this. Since it's a short example, there is only one bound, but instead of `T::BITS` we had to use a trick that isn't very good-looking:

```rust
use std::mem;
use num_traits::PrimInt;

impl<T: PrimInt> MyLog for T {
    fn my_log2(self) -> u32 {
        mem::size_of::<T>() as u32 * 8 - 1 - self.leading_zeros()
    }
}
```

## Conditional Code

The use of conditional inclusion of code offers more flexibility in the implementation. Within a trait-gen implementation, the attribute `#[trait_gen_if(T in Type1, Type2, Type3]` disables the attached code if `T` isn't in the list of types.

Here is an example:

```rust
use trait_gen::{trait_gen, trait_gen_if};

trait Binary {
    const DECIMAL_DIGITS: usize;
    const SIGN: bool = false;
    fn display_length() -> usize;
    fn try_neg(self) -> Option<Self> where Self: Sized { None }
}

#[trait_gen(T -> i8, u8, i32, u32)]
impl Binary for T {
    #[trait_gen_if(T in i8, u8)]
    const DECIMAL_DIGITS: usize = 3;
    #[trait_gen_if(T in i32, u32)]
    const DECIMAL_DIGITS: usize = 10;
    #[trait_gen_if(T in i8, i32)]
    const SIGN: bool = true;

    fn display_length() -> usize {
        Self::DECIMAL_DIGITS + if T::SIGN { 1 } else { 0 }
    }

    #[trait_gen_if(T in i8, i32)]
    fn try_neg(self) -> Option<Self> {
        Some(-self)
    }
}
```

The arguments can be placed on either side of `in`, so you can also use it to compare arguments, as shown below. Note the `!T in U`, which means the code is enabled when `T` is *not* in the given list, so here when `T != U`. 

```rust
use trait_gen::{trait_gen, trait_gen_if};

trait TypeEq<U> {
    fn same_type(&self, other: &U) -> bool;
}

#[trait_gen(T -> u8, u16, u32)]
#[trait_gen(U -> u8, u16, u32)]
impl TypeEq<U> for T {
    #[trait_gen_if(T in U)]
    fn same_type(&self, _other: &U) -> bool {
        true
    }
    #[trait_gen_if(!T in U)]
    fn same_type(&self, _other: &U) -> bool {
        false
    }
}
```

We've seen earlier that `type_gen` was a synonym of `trait_gen`. For the sake of coherency, a
`type_gen_if` is also provided as a synonym of `trait_gen_if`.

_Thanks to **Daniel Vigovszky** for giving me this idea! He first implemented it, although differently, in a fork called [conditional_trait_gen](https://github.com/vigoo/conditional_trait_gen). I had pondered about some use-cases that would require such a feature in an old post but never got around to implementing it until now._

## Examples

Here are a few examples of the substitutions that are supported; you'll find more in the [integration tests](https://github.com/blueglyph/trait_gen/blob/v1.1.0/tests/integration.rs) of the library. 

The first example is more an illustration of what is and isn't replaced than a practical implementation:

```rust
#[trait_gen(U -> u32, i32, u64, i64)]
impl AddMod for U {
    fn add_mod(self, other: U, m: U) -> U {
        const U: U = 0;
        let zero = U::default();
        let offset: super::U = super::U(0);
        (self + other + U + zero + offset.0 as U) % m
    }
}
```

is expanded into (we only show the first type, `u32`):
  
-   ```rust
    impl AddMod for u32 {
        fn add_mod(self, other: u32, m: u32) -> u32 {
            const U: u32 = 0;
            let zero = u32::default();
            let offset: super::U = super::U(0);
            (self + other + U + zero + offset.0 as u32) % m
        }
    }
    // ...
    ```

This example shows the use of type arguments in generic traits:

```rust
struct Meter<U>(U);
struct Foot<U>(U);

trait GetLength<T> {
    fn length(&self) -> T;
}

#[trait_gen(U -> f32, f64)]
impl GetLength<U> for Meter<U> {
    fn length(&self) -> U {
        self.0 as U
    }
}
```

This attribute can be combined with another one to create a _generic composition_, implementing the trait for `Meter<f32>`, `Meter<f64>`, `Foot<f32>`, `Foot<f64>`:

```rust
#[trait_gen(T -> Meter, Foot)]
#[trait_gen(U -> f32, f64)]
impl GetLength<U> for T<U> {
    fn length(&self) -> U {
        self.0 as U
    }
}
```

is expanded into this:

-   ```rust
    impl GetLength<f32> for Meter<f32> {
        fn length(&self) -> f32 { self.0 as f32 }
    }
    impl GetLength<f64> for Meter<f64> {
        fn length(&self) -> f64 { self.0 as f64 }
    }
    impl GetLength<f32> for Foot<f32> {
        fn length(&self) -> f32 { self.0 as f32 }
    }
    impl GetLength<f64> for Foot<f64> {
        fn length(&self) -> f64 { self.0 as f64 }
    }
    ```

Multisegment paths (paths with `::`) and path arguments (`<f32>`) can be used in the arguments. For example, `gen::U` is used to avoid any confusion with types if many single-letter types have already been defined.

Also, `Meter` and `Foot` **must** keep the `units` module path in the arguments because there wouldn't be a substitution if those paths were in the code (the type in `impl Add for units::gen::U` doesn't begin with `gen::U` and thus isn't replaced).

_Note: `gen` needn't any declaration since it's replaced by the macro._

```rust
#[trait_gen(gen::U -> units::Meter<f32>, units::Foot<f32>)]
impl Add for gen::U {
    type Output = gen::U;

    fn add(self, rhs: Self) -> Self::Output {
        gen::U(self.0 + rhs.0)
    }
}
```

More complicated types can be used, like references or slices. This example generates implementations for the immutable, mutable and boxed referenced types:

```rust
#[trait_gen(T -> u8, u16, u32, u64, u128)]
impl MyLog for T {
    fn my_log2(self) -> u32 {
        T::BITS - 1 - self.leading_zeros()
    }
}

#[trait_gen(T -> u8, u16, u32, u64, u128)]
#[trait_gen(U -> &T, &mut T, Box<T>)]
impl MyLog for U {
    fn my_log2(self) -> u32 {
        MyLog::my_log2(*self)
    }
}
```

As you see in the generic composition, the first generic argument `U` can be used in the second attribute argument list (the order of the attributes doesn't matter).

Finally, this example shows how the documentation and string literals can be customized in each implementation by using the `${T}` format:

```rust
trait Repr {
    fn text(&self) -> String;
}

#[trait_gen(T -> u32, i32, u64, i64)]
impl Repr for T {
    /// Produces a string representation for `${T}`
    fn text(&self) -> String {
        call("${T}");
        format!("${T}: {}", self)
    }
}

assert_eq!(1_u32.text(), "u32: 1");
assert_eq!(2_u64.text(), "u64: 2");
```

-   ```rust
    impl Repr for u32 {
        /// Produces a string representation for `u32`
        fn text(&self) -> String {
            call("u32");
            format!("u32: {}", self)
        }
    }
    // ...
    ```

_Note: there is no escape code to avoid the substitution; if you need `${T}` for another purpose and you don't want it to be replaced, you must use `concat!` in a doc attribute to split the pattern; for example `#[doc = concat!("my ${", "T} variable")]`. Or you must choose another generic argument; for example, `U` or `my::T`._ 

## Legacy Format

The attribute used a shorter format in earlier versions, which is still supported even though it may be more confusing to read:

```rust
#[trait_gen(Type1, Type2, Type3)]
impl Trait for Type1 {
    // ...
}
```

Here, the code is generated as is for `Type1`, and then `Type2` and `Type3` are substituted for `Type1` to generate their implementation. This is a shortcut for the equivalent attribute with the other format:

```rust
#[trait_gen(Type1 -> Type1, Type2, Type3)]
impl Trait for Type1 {
    // ...
}
```

The legacy format can be used when there is no risk of collision, like in the example below. All the `Meter` types must change, and it is unlikely to be mixed up with `Foot` and `Mile`. The type to replace in the code must be the first in the argument list:

```rust
use std::ops::Add;
use trait_gen::trait_gen;

pub struct Meter(f64);
pub struct Foot(f64);
pub struct Mile(f64);

#[trait_gen(Meter, Foot, Mile)]
impl Add for Meter {
    type Output = Meter;

    fn add(self, rhs: Meter) -> Self::Output {
        Self(self.0 + rhs.0)
    }
}
```

Be careful not to replace a type that must remain the same in all implementations! Consider the following example, in which the return type is always `u64`:

```rust
pub trait ToU64 {
    fn into_u64(self) -> u64;   // always returns a u64
}

#[trait_gen(u64, i64, u32, i32, u16, i16, u8, i8)]
impl ToU64 for u64 {
    fn into_u64(self) -> u64 {  // ERROR! Replaced by i64, u32, ...
        self as u64
    }
}
```

This code doesn't work because `u64` also happens to be the first type of the list. Use a different first type like `i64` or the non-legacy format instead.

## Alternative Format

An alternative format is also supported when the `in_format` feature is enabled:

```cargo
trait-gen = { version="1.2", features=["in_format"] }
```

**<u>Warning</u>: This feature is temporary, and there is no guarantee that it will be maintained.**

Here, `in` is used instead of an arrow `->`, and the argument types must be between square brackets:

```rust
use trait_gen::trait_gen;

#[trait_gen(T in [u8, u16, u32, u64, u128])]
impl MyLog for T {
    fn my_log2(self) -> u32 {
        T::BITS - 1 - self.leading_zeros()
    }
}
```

Using this format issues 'deprecated' warnings that you can turn off by adding the `#![allow(deprecated)]` directive at the top of the file or by adding `#[allow(deprecated)]` where the generated code is used.

The square brackets are optional since version 1.1: `#[trait_gen(T in u8, u16)]` is valid.

## IDE Code Awareness

_rust-analyzer_ supports procedural macros for code awareness, so everything should be fine for editors based on this Language Server Protocol implementation.

IDEs like RustRover and IntelliJ/CLion with the Rust plugin all "understand" procedural macros. The expansion is shown with "Show macro recursive expansion", among other actions, errors are correctly shown, all the code-awareness features seem to work as expected, and the code disabled by the conditional attribute appears in grey.

## Limitations

* The procedural macro of the `trait_gen` attribute can't handle scopes, so it doesn't support any type declaration with the same literal as the generic argument. For instance, this code fails to compile because of the generic function:

  ```rust
  use num::Num;
  use trait_gen::trait_gen;
  
  trait AddMod {
      type Output;
      fn add_mod(self, rhs: Self, modulo: Self) -> Self::Output;
  }
  
  #[trait_gen(T -> u64, i64, u32, i32)]
  impl AddMod for T {
      type Output = T;
  
      fn add_mod(self, rhs: Self, modulo: Self) -> Self::Output {
          fn int_mod<T: Num> (a: T, m: T) -> T { // <== ERROR, conflicting 'T'
              a % m
          }
          int_mod(self + rhs, modulo)
      }
  }
  ```

* The generic argument must be a [type path](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/paths.html#paths-in-types); it cannot be a more complex type like a reference or a slice. So you can use `gen::T<U> -> ...` but not `&T -> ...`.
